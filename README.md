# Feline Scabies Data Analysis

This project analyzes the epidemiological data of Feline Scabies, a parasitic skin disease in cats. The dataset includes cases recorded across regions, along with demographics and possible seasonal or environmental patterns.

## 🐾 Objectives

- Analyze patterns of scabies outbreaks in feline populations
- Identify risk factors or peak seasons
- Practice basic data science skills (Excel & Python)
- Apply veterinary knowledge with real-world data

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `FELINE SCABIES EPIDEMIOLOGY.xlsx`
- Source: Veterinary records collected for academic use
- Contents: Region, age, breed, symptoms, diagnosis time, and treatment data

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Excel for initial data organization
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for analysis and visualization *(coming soon)*
- GitHub for version control and portfolio sharing

## 🧪 Analysis Plan

1. Clean the data (handle missing/invalid entries)
2. Basic stats: Case count by region, month, breed
3. Visualize trends (bar charts, pie charts, line plots)
4. Summary and insights
